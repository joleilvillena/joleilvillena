I am an experienced Data Scientist with a <b>growth mindset</b>, a <b>diverse technical skillset</b>, and <b>strong strategic thinking</b> and <b>business acumen</b>. Before pivoting into Tech, I worked in <b>Data Analytics</b>, <b>Valuations</b>, and <b>Strategy</b> projects in <b>M&A Consulting</b> at a <b>Big Four</b> firm.

I gravitate toward <b>purpose-driven</b> and <b>high-impact</b> projects. I am currently focused on growing my expertise in implementing <b>state-of-the-art</b> and <b>novel approaches</b> in Machine Learning and applications of <b>Generative AI (Gen AI)</b> to business solutions.

Outside of work, I enjoy building model kits 🧰, exploring third-wave coffee ☕, and immersing myself in art events 🎨.
